scratched-XY model: Numerical date for the strong randomness criticality in the scratched-XY model
=================================================

Open access data to supplement our preprint.
Please refer to this main text for an in-depth discussion.
This README provides information on how the data, which is made available in this repo, is structured.

Project Structure
-----------------

We provide open data and a plotting script to generate Figs. 1 - 4 in our preprint.


Requirements
------------

Mathematica
  

General Usage
-------------

Data for the disorder averaged K is provided in the files 'averageK_~'
Data for the distribution of the renormalized scratches is provided in the files 'histogram_L~'

The data can be downloaded together with the Mathematica notebook. Executing the Mathematica notebook will generate Fig. 1 - 4 in our preprint.
