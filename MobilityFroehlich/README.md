Structure
---------

Data for Figs 2,3, and 4 of the main text are made available in the subdirectories with the same name.
For units and conventions we refer to the main text.

### Figure 2

The file "dc-mobility.dat" contains the result of the analytic continuation for the mobility at zero frequency, which is plotted in the paper (alpha = 2.5).
There are five columns: (i) the inverse temperature beta actually used in the simulation, (ii) the temperature T = 1/beta used for plotting, (iii) the value of the dc mobility, (iv) its lower error bar, and (v) its upper error bar.

The matsubara data for the quantity C_m (see Eq. 7 in the paper) is provided in the files named "betaxxxx.dat" where xxxx stands for the inverse temperature specified in the first column on "dc-mobility.dat". These files contain three columns: (i) the Matsubara index m, (ii) the quantity C_m, and (iii) its error bar obtained from 20-40 independent runs depending on the temperature.

same as for Fig 2.

### Figure 4

Analytically continued data for the mobility as a function of frequency, mu(omega), are provided in the files named "Txxx.dat" where xxx stands for the corresponding temperature. There are 2 columns: (i) the frequency omega, and (ii) the corresponding mobility. 

The file "seeOC.gp" is optional and contains a gnuplot script to 



Requirements
------------

Only a text viewer is needed to read the data. An optional gnuplot-file is provided for Fig 4.
