Magnetism in the two-dimensional dipolar XY model
=================================================

Open access data to supplement the paper "Magnetism in the two-dimensional dipolar XY model" by B. Sbierski, M. Bintz, S. Chatterjee, M. Schuler, N. Y. Yao, and L. Pollet. Please refer to this main text for an in-depth discussion.
THIS README provides information on how the data, which is made available in this repo, is structured

Structure
---------

Data from quantum Monte Carlo simulations and corresponding plotting scripts are made available in the subdirectories.
For units and conventions we refer to the main text.


Requirements
------------

Only a text viewer is needed to read the data, and a pdf viewer to view the plots. 
Python3 with numpy and matplotlib are needed to generate the plots.
